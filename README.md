1) Variables - 

Struct and classes - Made classes for boss, and player character each classes have varialbes int curHealth, int attDamage, and string name. You can initiate those variables under int main() by using setMaxHealth(), setAttDamage() and setName(), but it also has default variables. You can see those values by doing getMaxHealth(), getAttDamage(), and getName() each functions are going to return the variable values. Also, made an operator+ and operator- which will calculate the damage the player has done or recieved to boss.
