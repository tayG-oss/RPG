Variables: A vector is used to print out the map. And variables are used to help print out the map, and determine the positions of both the player and other interactable characters (Enemies and puzzles)

Branches: The barriers and walls in the map use branches. Based on which side of the wall the character is going against, the code will determine whether it will move the character back either left or right, or up or down.

Input and Output: When user press either 'W', 'A', 'S', or 'D', the output is the character moving in a different direction

Structs/Classes: Made classes for boss, and player character each classes have HP, attack damage, and name. You can initiate those variables under int main() by using setMaxHealth(), setAttDamage and setName(), but it also has default varariables. You can see those values by doing getMaxHealth(), getAttDamage(), and getName().


Create puzzles

Algebra: Different varaibles are constanltly referenced throughout the code to do different things. 



Loop: In puzzles 2 and 3, while loops are used to reiterate certain parts of code until the correct input. Also in puzzle 3, a for loop is placed to make every input from the user lowercase. Loops are also used for gameplay mechanics.



Functions: In puzzle 1, two functions are being used. The first function is the equation to integrate. The second function is the integration that used leftside Riemann Sum to calculate the first function. Also, three different functions are used to setup the world map and to move around in it.
