Algebra: Different varaibles are constanltly referenced throughout the code to do different things. 



Loop: In puzzles 2 and 3, while loops are used to reiterate certain parts of code until the correct input. Also in puzzle 3, a for loop is placed to make every input from the user lowercase. Loops are also used for gameplay mechanics.



Functions: In puzzle 1, two functions are being used. The first function is the equation to integrate. The second function is the integration that used leftside Riemann Sum to calculate the first function. Also, three different functions are used to setup the world map and to move around in it.
